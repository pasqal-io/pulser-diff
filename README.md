# pulser-diff

Differentiable backend for pulse-level quantum simulation framework ``pulser`` that utilizes solvers from `dynamiqs` library. 

`pulser-diff` aims to provide completely differentiable quantum states/expectations through use of automatic differentiation capabilities of underlying `torch` package.
